# sleeping-beauty
The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon, which is a part of the Tc1/mariner family, is a widely used genetic tool in gene therapy and the creation of genome-wide mutations. DNA transposons, including SB, typically show a strong preference for specific integration sites. It has been commonly understood that SB and other Tc1/mariner transposons strictly integrate into TA dinucleotides.
Here I have created a pipeline for extraction of Sleeping Beauty from single end reads.
